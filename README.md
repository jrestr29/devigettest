# Deviget Test
*By: Jos√© David Restrepo B.*

Following are the screenshots that explains the visual and funcionality used to develop the Deviget test, most of the template is bases on the **PSD** provided and taking in mind that it doesn't was specific for other pages more than the **landing page** so please expect that some code should be refactorized to be properly and safely used on a fully functional Magento Theme. Theme was coded taking in mind the *responsive first* pattern, some of backend code was needed to be developed as **Jose_Deviget** module in order to create some Blocks and Widgets needed.

 ### Search 
 In this particular case I took in mind the *TheNextWeb.com* approach bue due to time and view complexity I prefer to use my own approach with a search input that appears and disappears and can be animated using jQuery or CSS transitions
